# Embedded Debezium

This project is a trivial example of how to use the [Debezium Embedded
Engine](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.4/development/engine.html)
to capture changes from a postgres database.

I wrote it while prototyping a new feature for
[TypeStream](https://github.com/typestreamio/typestream).
